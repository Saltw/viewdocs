# Welcome to Viewdocs

Viewdocs is [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) meets [Gist.io](http://gist.io/) for simple Markdown project documentation.

Just make a `docs` directory in your Github project repository and put an `index.md` file in there to get started. Then browse to:

	http://<github-username>.viewdocs.io/<repository-name>

Any other Markdown files in your `docs` directory are available as a subpath, including files in directories. Here are [two](/viewdocs/example) [examples](/viewdocs/example/subexample). Now look at the [source](http://github.com/progrium/viewdocs). While you're there, notice this app is written in about 150 lines of Go.

You can update pages by just pushing to your repository or editing directly on Github. It takes 1-2 minutes before changes will appear.

For the adventurous, make your own `docs/template.html` based on the [default template](https://github.com/progrium/viewdocs/blob/master/docs/template.html).

If you want to hack on it, please [check this out](/viewdocs/development).

Enjoy!<br />
