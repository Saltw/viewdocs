# Welcome to Viewdocs

[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) meets [Gist.io](http://gist.io/) for simple Markdown project documentation from your Github repository's `docs` directory.

Just make a `docs` directory in your project repository and put an `index.md` file in there to get started. Then browse to:

	http://<github-username>.viewdocs.io/<repository-name>

Any other Markdown files in your `docs` directory are available as a subpath, including files in directories. Here are [two](/viewdocs/example) [examples](/viewdocs/example/subexample). Now look at the [source](http://github.com/progrium/viewdocs). While you're there, notice this app is written in about 100 lines of Go.
